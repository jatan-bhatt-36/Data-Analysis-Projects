# Ride sharing company in Chicago

Project Description:

You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
You'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. 

Steps to complete:
- import the files
- study the data they contain
- make sure the data types are correct
- identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs
- make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs
- draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results

Test the Hypothesis:
 - "The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."

Decide where to set the significance level (alpha) on your own. Explain:
 - how you formed the null and alternative hypotheses
 - what criterion you used to test the hypotheses and why
